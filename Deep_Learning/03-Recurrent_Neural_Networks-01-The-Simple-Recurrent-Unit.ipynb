    "# 20. The Simple Recurrent Unit\n",
    "We are now going to talk about the _**simple recurrent unit**_, also known as the _Elman Unit_. But before we do that, I want to quickly touch on _sequences_. This is going to look slightly different from the data that we are used to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our input data $X$ is usually represented with an $NxD$ matrix ($N$ samples and $D$ features); there are no sequences here. Well, let's suppose that we did have a sequence of length $T$. How many dimensions would that require? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if the observation was a $D$ dimensional vector, and we have $T$ of them, then one sequence of observation will be a $TxD$ matrix. If we have $N$ training samples, then we will end up with an $NxTxD$ matrix, which is a 3 dimensional object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes our sequences are not of equal length, such as the cases with sentences, music, sound, or even someones credit history. How can we handle this? We have encountered this problem in the Hidden Markov Notebooks. The solution is to store each observation in a python list. So, instead of a 3 dimensional matrix, we will have a length $N$ list where each element is a 2-d observation sequence as a numpy array. Because a python list can contain any object as an element, this is okay. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Simple Recurrent Unit \n",
    "Okay, now we can dig into our simple recurrent unit. Take a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer: \n",

    "\n",
    "The input layer and output layer will stay exactly the same, they are actually not part of the recurrent unit itself. However, they are included here for context. What we want to do is create a feedback connection from the hidden layer to itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tGeRQ2PZsHbFq8XFsj32NC3gQ-46ilWZ\" width=\"300\">\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the feedback loop implies that there is a delay of one time unit. So, one of the input units into $h(t)$ is $h(t-1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A question that you may have is: How big is $W_h$? Just like the other layers, we connect \"everything-to-everything\". So, if there are $M$ hidden units, the first hidden unit connects back to all $M$ units, the second hidden unit connects back to all $M$ units, and so on. In total there will be $M^2$ hidden to hidden weights. Hence, $W_h$ is an $MxM$ matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Simple Recurrent Mathematical Output\n",
    "Here is how we would represent the output of a recurrent net in math:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(t) = f \\big(W_h^T h(t-1) + W_x^T x(t) + b_h\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = softmax\\big(W_o^T h(t) + b_o\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the feedback connection represents a time delay of 1, so the hidden layer takes in both $x$ and its last hidden value. Also, note that $f$ can be any of the usual nonlinearities, such as the sigmoid, tanh, or ReLu. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Not The Markov Assumption\n",
    "One thing that is worth noting is that this is not the Markov Assumption. Why is that? Well, even though $h(t)$ is defined in terms of its previous value, it's previous value can be defined in terms of the value before that, and so on:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(t) = f \\big(W_h^T h(t-1) + W_x^T x(t) + b_h\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(t) = f \\Big(W_h^T f \\big( W_h^T h(t-2) + W_x^T x(t-1) + b_h \\big) + W_x^T x(t) + b_h\\Big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that $h(t)$ has to have an initial state, $h(0)$. Sometimes researchers will set this to 0, and other times it will be a hyperparameter that we can use back propagation on. Since theano automatically differentiates things for us, we will treat it as an updatable parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 More Layers \n",
    "One question you may have is can we add more than one recurrent unit to the network:\n",

    "\n",
    "The answer is yes! The number of recurrent layers is a hyperparameter, just like how the number of hidden layers is a parameter for a regular feed forward net. The question of how many depends on your type of specific problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "And that is all there is to it! Just by adding that one hidden layer, we have created a recurrent neural network! We will see in the coding networks how this can already do some amazing things, such as exponentially decrease the number of hidden units we would have needed in a feed forward neural network. "

    "# 2. Prediction and Relationship to Markov Models\n",
    "We are now going to look more closely at what a recurrent neural network can predict, and talk about how under certain circumstances, we can relate it back to what we know about Markov Models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a time component gives us a few more options in terms of the objective, or in other words _what we are trying to predict_. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Softmax\n",
    "Let's being by talking about something we know already: Softmax and Multiclass classification. So, suppose we take an entire sequence, and take the argmax of the softmax, and use that as the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Prediction = argmax_k \\big( p(y=k \\mid x)\\big) = argmax_k \\big( softmax(W_o^T h(t)) + b_o\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What assumption have we made? Well, first and foremost we forgot about the time component, but we will get to that shortly. The thing that we are assuming is that the entire sequence corresponds to one class. This makes perfect sense for a lot of problems. For example, if we wanted to classify between male and female voices, you would have sound samples from males and females. If you were looking at one sound file of a male saying \"Hello world\", the class for that sample is male; one sequence, one label. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Prediction(t) = argmax_k \\big( p(y(t)=k \\mid x)\\big) = argmax_k \\big( softmax(W_o^T h(t)) + b_o\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But, we can't forget that for every $h(t)$ there is a $y(t)$. $y(t)$ is just the final layer calculated from $h(t)$. So, technically we could have a label for every time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some situations where this may be useful? Well, let's think about brain computer interfaces. These are systems that are constantly reading electrical signals from your brain. Suppose the purpose of this brain computer interface is for controlling a wheelchair. Considering the wheelchair is how you will get around, you will need fine grain controll on the device. So, it moves forward, stops, turns left, etc, when you want it to. These would be our labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Labels = \\{ forward, stop, left, right, back\\}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We want the action to be taken right as we think of it. In this case we would need a $y(t)$ for every $x(t)$. So this is precisely a situation where we would want to have not just one label for one sequence, but one label for every moment in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now consider a third situation. Suppose we are looking at a sequence of words, or in other words, sentences. As is typical, we want to predict the next word given all of the previous words (our target is the previous word). What is interesting about this is that it is essentially unsupervised learning, since there is essentially no target label-the target is just the input. In other words, we are trying to model the probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p\\big( x(t) \\mid x(t-1), x(t-2),...,x(1)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the current hidden state depends on all of the previous hidden states, so this is _not_ the markov assumption. Consider what happens when we try to make the whole input sequence the target sequence; we are trying to model the probability: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$p\\big(x(1)\\big)p\\big(x(2) \\mid x(1)\\big)p\\big(x(3) \\mid x(2), x(1)\\big)...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what happens if we join the first two terms together? Using bayes rule we get the joint probability of $p\\big( x(2), x(1)\\big)$:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$p\\big( x(3), x(2), x(1)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the chain rule of probability. Eventually what we end up with is just the joint probability of the entire sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Joint Probability\n",
    "That is very interesting, because it is exactly what we are trying to optimize with Hidden Markov Models! So, we can see that with Recurrent Neural Networks we can optimize the same thing as HMM's, but without making the markov assumption. This could lead us to the intuition that these RNN's may be more powerful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that, if you recall, HMM's suffer from the fact that longer sequences have probabilities that go down to zero, because you are continually multiplying values together that are less than 1. Luckily, we don't have that problem with RNN's, and the fact that we have the joint probability is implicit in the model itself, so there is no need to calculate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Summary\n",
    "To conclude, we have identified 3 different ways of using RNN's for prediction. \n",
    "> 1. Predict one label over entire sequence (e.g. differentiate between male and female voices.\n",
    "2. Predict a label for every step of input sequence (e.g. control device using BCI)\n",

This will be different depending on whether you have a target for every time step, or a target just at the end of a sequence. The arrows going from left to right must always be backpropagated, because these are the hidden to hidden weights. \n",

    "## 4.2 Vanishing Gradient / Exploding Gradient\n",
    "One thing to realize here is that the same things are going to be multiplied again and again due to the chain rule of calculus. This will happen for both the hidden to hidden weights, as well as the input to hidden weights. The result is that you will either have something that goes down to 0, or gets large very quickly. This is referred to as the _vanish gradient_ and _exploding gradient_ problem respectively. \n",

    "## 4.3 Truncated BPTT\n",
    "Another modification of back propagation through time is **truncated backpropagation through time**. Because the derivatives of $W_h$ and $W_x$ depend on every single time step of the sequence so far, the calculation will take a very long time for very long sequences. One approximation is just to stop after a certain number of time steps. One disadvantage of this is that it won't incorporate the error at longer periods of time. However, if you don't care about dependencies at greater than 3 time steps, then you can just truncate at 3 time steps. "

    "We are now going to go back to the _XOR_ problem, but with an additional twist. Recall, the XOR problem is simply to implement the XOR logic gate using a neural network. The result is a zero if the two inputs are the same, and the result is a 1 if the two inputs are different:\n",

    "### 5.1 Background\n",
    "Just for a bit of background, I should mention that the parity problem occurs in a few different places in computer science. One application is data transmission in communication systems. If you imagine that a source is trying to send a bit stream to a receiver, but one of the bits gets reversed via noise, how can we detect this? One simple way to do this is to add a parity bit to the end of each message. We set a requirement that each message must have an even number of ones, and if the actual message has an odd number of ones, we will make the parity bit a one to make the total even. If the actual message already has an even number of ones, we will make the parity bit a zero so that the total is still even. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{M = 0 1 0 1} \\rightarrow \\text{P = 0} \\rightarrow \\text{Transmit: 0 1 0 1 0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, when the receiver gets the message, it can check how many ones their are, and if it is odd then we know something has gone wrong in the transmission of the message. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Why Not Use A Regular Feedforward Net\n",
    "If you were to try and solve the parity problem with a regular feedforward net, you will see that the number of hidden units will grow very fast compared to the number of bits. For example, if for one bit, we would need two hidden units. As we jumped to 12 bits, we would need:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2^{11} = 2048$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can mitigate this problem by creating deeper networks with less units per layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Solving the Parity Problem with RNNs\n",
    "The basic idea here is that we would like the Neural Network to keep track of its state. So, if the output is 0 and we see another 1 in the input, we would like to switch to a 1. If the output is 1 and we see another 1 in the input, we would like to switch to a 0. If we see a 0 in the input, we would just like to maintain whatever the current output is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Can our RNN actually do this? Well, before answering that, let's think about what type of labeling we are dealing with; there are 3 different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One label for every sequence.\n",
    "2. **T labels for sequence of length T**.\n",
    "3. No labels, we just want to predict the next observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is clearly type 2, where we care about the output at every point in time. To do this, we will need to discard the original label (which is just one number), and create a sequence of labels, which will be a sequence of the same size as the input, which just keeps a tally of whether it has seen an even or odd number of inputs so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**<br>\n",
    "Let's go through an example; suppose we are working with a dimensionality of 4. Then our possible inputs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "|input 1| Target | Sequence Target|\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "|0000|0|0000|\n",
    "|0001|1|0001|\n",

    "|0111|1|0101|\n",
    "|...|...|...|\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the entire purpose of our `sequence targets` is to keep track of whether we have seen an even or odd number of ones so far. So, the last number in our `sequence targets` will always be equivalent to the number in the `Targets` column. "
