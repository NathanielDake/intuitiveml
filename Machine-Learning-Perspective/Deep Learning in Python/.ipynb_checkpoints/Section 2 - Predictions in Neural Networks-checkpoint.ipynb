    "In the past we have looked at both logistic regression and binary classification. There, we would collect some data, and then try to predict 1 of 2 possible labels. For example, if we were dealing with an e-commerce stie, we could collect _**time spent on site**_ and _**number of pages viewed**_, and then try to predict whether someone is going to buy something on the site. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we only have 2 dimensions. We will plot the information, and then try to use a straight line to classify the classes (buy or not buy):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma \\big( w_1*(\\text{time spent on site}) + w_2 (\\text{number pages viewed})\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are able to find a line that goes between the classes, they are _linearly seperable_. When we are dealing with data that is linearly seperable, logistic regression is fine, since it is a linear classifier. So, in 2 dimensions linearly seperable data can be separated via a line, in 3 dimensions a plane, and and 4+ dimensions a hyperplane. The point is, no matter how many dimensions we are dealing with, our decision boundary is going to be straight, not curved. \n",

    "## 1.1 Neural Networks Add Non-linearity\n",
    "Now, as we get into the realm of Neural Networks, things begin to change. We can have non-linearly seperable variables, such as: \n",

    "$$w_1x_1 + w_2x_2+...+w_nx_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w^T x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, just a reminder, in the vector notation $w_T x$, the weights are transposed because by convention they are stored as a column vector, but we need to be able to perform matrix vector multiplicaton (akin to the dot product in this case) with the input vector $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can see that anything that cannot be simplified into $w^Tx$ is nonlinear. Now, $x^2$ and $x^3$ are both nonlinear, but neural networks are nonlinear in a _very specific way_. Neural Networks achieve nonlinearity by:\n",

    "# 2. Logistic Regression $\\rightarrow$ Neural Networks\n",
    "We are now ready to start the transition from logistic regression to neural networks. Recall that logistic regression is a neuron, and we are going to be connecting many together to make a network of neurons. The most basic way to do this is the _**feed forward method**_. For logistic regression, we have a weight corresponding to every input:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images2/logistic-reg-unit.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This is seen clearly in the image above. We have two input features, $x_1$ and $x_2$, but of course there can be many more. Each input feature has a corresponding weight, $w_1$ and $w_2$. In order to determine the output $y$, we multiply each input by its weight, sum them all together, add a bias term, and put it through a sigmoid function:\n",

    "If our prediction is greater than 0.5, we predict class 1, otherwise we predict class 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Extend to a Neural Network\n",
    "Now, in order to extend this concept to that of a neural network, the main thing we need to do is just add more logistic regression layers (i.e. neurons):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images2/multilayer-neurons.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working mainly with 1 extra layer, but an arbitrary number can be added. In recent years, researchers have found amazing success with deeper networks, hence the term _deep learning_. The first step is of course to just add 1 layer, and our calculations are the exact same! \n",
    "\n",
    "> We multiply each input by its weight (linear combination), add the bias, and pass it through a sigmoid function. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is how we get each value at node $z$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_j = \\sigma \\big(\\sum_i (W_{ij}x_j + b_j)\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where in the above equation our $x$ inputs are indexed by $i$, and the $z$ nodes are indexed by $j$. Also, notice that our set of weights $w$ is now a matrix. This is because there needs to be a weight for each input-output pair. Hence, since we have 2 inputs and 3 outputs, we need there to be 6 weights in total. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Nonlinearities\n",
    "We have already spoken about the fact that the main things that makes neural networks so powerful is that they are nonlinear classifiers. We have already gone over one of the most common nonlinear functions utilized in this architecture, the sigmoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also several other nonlinearities that we will cover soon, such as _tanh_ and the _RELU_. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Vectorization\n",
    "From an implementation standpoint, remember that it is faster to use the numpy matrix and vector operations, compared to using python for loops. Hence, we are going to treat our system layers as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * $X$ is going to be a **_D dimensional vector_** (D is 2 in the above diagram)\n",
    "* $Z$ is going to be an **_M dimensional vector_** (M is 3 in the above diagram)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that Z is going to look like: \n",

    "\n",
    "$$z = \\sigma \\big(W^Tx) + b\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Matrix Notation\n",
    "The above is pretty good, but we can do even better! In general, we have _many_ data points, and we want to consider more than one sample at a time. So, we can further vectorize our calculations, by using the full input matrix of data! \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be an $NxD$ matrix, where $N$ is the number of samples and $D$ is the dimensionality. Because we will then be calculating everything at the same time, $z$ will then be an $NxM$ matrix. The output $y$ will be an $Nx1$ matrix (for binary classification, for $k$ classes it will be $Nxk$. It is important that our weights all have the correct shape. Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Weights:**\n",
    "* $W$ is $DxM$\n",
    "* The first bias, $b$ is $Mx1$\n",
    "* The output weight $v$ is an $Mx1$ vector\n",
    "* The output bias $c$ is a scalar\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images2/matrix-visualization-1.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2.5 Intuition Via the Dot Product\n",
    "Now, when just learning about Neural Networks, it is _very_ easy to become lost in a fog of matrices, arrows pointing from node to node, transposes, and so on. Something that I feel is absolutely crucial to really have a good understanding for what is going on here is having a good understanding of the _**dot product**_, and being able to keep it in mind as we get into more complex networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have a notebook that delves into the dot product, linear combinations, and linear transformations in great detail in my _linear algebra_ section of the Math Appendix. I highly recommend reviewing it if you are a bit hazy on the dot product, but I will give a quick overview here as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider for a moment that our $x$ input is a _vector_. We have been representing it simply via an array of numbers, but we can think about it _geometrically_ as well. This is of course only possible in 3 dimensions, since humans cannot think in any dimensionality larger than that, but for now let's assume that $x$ is a 3 dimensional vector. Now, if we have another 3 dimensional vector, $v$, and take the dot product of it with $x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\cdot v$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are essentially getting a measure of _similarity_. The closer these two vectors are in direction and magnitude, the _larger their dot product_. If they are perpendicular to eachother, their dot product is 0. If they are pointing in opposite directions, their dot product is negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in both the our logistic regression unit (neuron) and neural networks, we are taking dot products! (In both cases, we start with simply taking a linear combination, but after transitioning to matrix vector notation we are able to refer to it as a dot product). This can be seen clearly in the diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images2/dot-product-1.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through what is happening above:\n",
    "> * We have an $X$ matrix as our input, but for now we are only focusing on the first row (which we can think of as a row vector)\n",
    "* This row vector of $X$, seen in the green box, then multiplied (via the dot product) by the first column in the weight matrix $W$. Technically this is matrix vector multiplication of a 1x3 matrix by a 3x1 vector, but based on _duality_ if functions in the same fashion as the dot product. \n",
    "* This dot product results in _a single value_, $z_1$, the first node in the matrix $Z$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the mechanics of the above process have been outlined, consider this: We know that the weights will eventually need to be _learned_. We don't know how to do this yet, but we know that that is coming up. Assume that they have been learned. What does the first column of $W$ represent? It is a learned representation of the first node of $Z$! From a high level we can view this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * Input a single sample, and vector $x$. \n",
    "* In order to calculate the value of $z_1$ (the first node in $Z$), take the dot product with the first column of the weight matrix, $W$.\n",
    "* $z_1$ will be large when the vector $x$ and the first column of $W$ are _similar_! And it will be negative when they are very different (geometrically). \n",
    "* Hence, a way to think about the learned weights of the first column in $W$ is that they are meant to be a vector represenation of $z_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a pretty powerful way of viewing something that can so frequently be incredibly abstract. If it is still slightly confusing, the diagram below should help:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images2/dot-product-2.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we have the _hidden layer_ to the _output layer/node_. This is no different than the simple logistic neuron, and we can even think of the hidden layer as the input layer if it helps simplify things. Here, again we have 3 nodes in the first row of $Z$, that are being multiplied via $V$. This will give us a prediction. Now, if the result of the dot product between the first row of $Z$ and $V$ is large, then the value of our output node (which is representing class 1), will be large after going through the sigmoid function, and we will predict class 1. _If_ the dot product ends up being negative, then we will predict class 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that our $V$ matrix can be thought of as a learned representation of class 1! Now, this of course loses meaning as we add layers and different components to our network, particularly the nonlinearities introduced by the sigmoid/RELU. But it is still a useful intuiton to have, making use of the underlying geometry of the system!"

    "At this point we would like to calculate the output, $p(Y=1 \\mid X)$. In other to do this, we need to multiply our hidden layer by $V$, add $c$, and run that value through the sigmoid function. Just as with the input to hidden weights, each of the Vs also connects 1 node in the hidden layer to the output node. So, visually our calculation looks like:\n",
