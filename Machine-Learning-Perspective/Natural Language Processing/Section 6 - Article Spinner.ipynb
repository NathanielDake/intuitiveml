    "# Markov Chains and Monte Carlo Methods\n",
    "* Great tutorial: https://deeplearning4j.org/markovchainmontecarlo\n",
    "* Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a mathematical method that draws samples randomly from a black-box to approximate the probability distribution of attributes over a range of objects (the height of men, the names of babies, the outcomes of events like coin tosses, the reading levels of school children, the rewards resulting from certain actions) or the futures of states.\n",
    "* MCMC methods help gauge the distribution of an outcome or statistic you’re trying to predict, by randomly sampling from a complex probabilistic space.\n",
    "* As with all statistical techniques, we sample from a distribution when we don’t know the function to succinctly describe the relation to two variables (actions and rewards). MCMC helps us approximate a black-box probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concrete Example\n",
    "Let’s say you’re a gambler in the saloon of a Gold Rush town and you roll a suspicious die without knowing if it is fair or loaded. You roll a six-sided die a hundred times, count the number of times you roll a four, and divide by a hundred. That gives you the probability of four in the total distribution. If it’s close to 16.7 (1/6 * 100), the die is probably fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo looks at the results of rolling the die many times and tallies the results to determine the probabilities of different states. It is an inductive method, drawing from experience. The die has a state space of six, one for each side.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Systems and States\n",
    "At a more abstract level, where words mean almost anything at all, a system is a set of things connected together (you might even call it a graph, where each state is a vertex, and each transition is an edge). It’s a set of states, where each state is a condition of the system. But what are states?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cities on a map are “states”. A road trip strings them together in transitions. The map represents the system.\n",
    "* Words in a language are states. A sentence is just a series of transitions from word to word.\n",
    "* Genes on a chromosome are states. To read them (and create amino acids) is to go through their transitions.\n",
    "* Web pages on the Internet are states. Links are the transitions.\n",
    "* Bank accounts in a financial system are states. Transactions are the transitions.\n",
    "* Emotions are states in a psychological system. Mood swings are the transitions.\n",
    "* Social media profiles are states in the network. Follows, likes, messages and friending are the transitions.\n",
    "* Rooms in a house are states. People walking through doorways are the transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So states are an abstraction used to describe these discrete, separable, things. A group of those states bound together by transitions is a system. And those systems have structure, in that some states are more likely to occur than others (ocean, land), or that some states are more likely to follow others.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are more like to read the sequence Paris -> France than Paris -> Texas, although both series exist, just as we are more likely to drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas than from L.A. to Slab City, although both places are nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of all possible states is known as the “state space.” The more states you have, the larger the state space gets, and the more complex your combinatorial problem becomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov Chains\n",
    "Since states can occur one after another, it may make sense to traverse the state space, moving from one to the next. A Markov chain is a probabilistic way to traverse a system of states. It traces a series of transitions from one state to another. It’s a random walk across a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each current state may have a set of possible future states that differs from any other. For example, you can’t drive straight from Atlanta to Seattle - you’ll need to hit other states in between. We are all, always, in such corridors of probabilities; from each state, we face an array of possible future states, which in turn offer an array of future states two degrees away from the start, changing with each step as the state tree unfolds. New possibilites open up, others close behind us. Since we generally don’t have enough compute to explore every possible state of a game tree for complex games like go, one trick that organizations like DeepMind use is Monte Carlo Tree Search to narrow the beam of possibilities to only those states that promise the most likely reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traversing a Markov chain, you’re not sampling with a God’s-eye view any more like a conquering alien. You are in the middle of things, groping your way toward one of several possible future states step by probabilistic step, through a Markov Chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our journeys across a state space may seem unique, like road trips across America, an infinite number of road trips would slowly give us a picture of the country as a whole, and the network that links its cities together. This is known as an equilibrium distribution. That is, given infinite random walks through a state space, you can come to know how much total time would be spent in any given state. If this condition holds, you can use Monte Carlo methods to initiate randoms “draws”, or walks through the state space, in order to sample it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov Time\n",
    "Markov chains have a particular property: oblivion, or forgetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, they have no long-term memory. They know nothing beyond the present, which means that the only factor determining the transition to a future state is a Markov chain’s current state. You could say the “m” in Markov stands for “memoryless”: A woman with amnesia pacing through the rooms of a house without knowing why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you might say that Markov Chains assume the entirety of the past is encoded in the present, so we don’t need to know anything more than where we are to infer where we will be next. Check out a visual demo here: http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/\n",
    "\n",
    "So imagine the current state as the input data, and the distribution of attributes related to those states (perhaps that attribute is reward, or perhaps it is simply the most likely future states), as the output. From each state in the system, by sampling you can determine the probability of what will happen next, doing so recursively at each step of the walk through the system’s states.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability as a Spaced\n",
    "When they call it a state space, they’re not joking. You can picture it, just like you can picture land and water, each one of them a probability as much as they are a physical thing. Unfold a six-sided die and you have a flattened state space in six equal pieces, shapes on a plane. Line up the letters by their frequency for 11 different languages, and you get 11 different state spaces.\n",
