    "There is a magician who has two biased coins, _coin 1_ and _coin 2_ that he is flipping. We are trying to determine the probability of observing the following sequence of coin flips:<br>\n",

We are told that the magician really likes coin 1, so the initial state distribution is:<br>\n",

    "We now have all of the information needed to find the probability of the sequence $H,H,T$. Intuitively, we can think about it as follows: We must first take into account the probability that we start in specific state, and from that state we observed heads. We then must account for the probability that from that state we transition to another hidden state and observe heads. And finally, we must take into the account that from the second hidden state we transition to _another_ hidden state and observe tails. Let's look at each part separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 The probability of the Initial State\n",
    "We can write the probability of the initial state and observing heads as:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$p\\big(x(2)=1|z(2)\\big) = B\\big(z(2),x(2)=1\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we repeated this process for transitioning from state 2 to 3, we would end up with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p\\big(x,z \\big) = \\pi\\big(z(1)\\big)p\\big(x(1)=1|z(1)\\big) * p\\big(z(2)|z(1)\\big) * p\\big(x(2)=1|z(2)\\big) * p\\big(z(3)|z(2)\\big) * p\\big(x(3)=0|z(3)\\big)$$\n",

Again, the $-1$ is a constant and we will be removed, leaving us with a complexity of $O(M^2T)$. Note, following this we would have expected to get $2^2*3 = 12 \\text{ operations}$, yet we came up with 19, why?

For instance, if at time $t=1$ we were at coin 1, it is less likely to also be there at time $t=2$ (based on the figity nature of the magician). So, if at time $t=1$ we observed heads, which we know is more probable from coin 1, we would be less likely to think the magician was holding coin 1 at time $t=2$ (since he most likely switched to coin 1). \n",

Surely that must be wrong, considering our original $B$ matrix had non zero probabilities for for heads and tails? Yet, on closer inspection it makes a lot of sense. Based on our one, simple/small training sequence, heads was observed twice, and tails was observed on the last time step, which is _not_ factored into the udpate of $B$ (we sum up to $T-1$). Hence, as far as our update equations were concerned, they _have never seen a tails emission_ and the probability must then be 0. Now, this is of course a shortcoming of our example, but never the less we can see how sparsity may come into play if we aren't careful; in other words, zero probabilities being assigned to situations which certainly can occur, due to lack of training data.
