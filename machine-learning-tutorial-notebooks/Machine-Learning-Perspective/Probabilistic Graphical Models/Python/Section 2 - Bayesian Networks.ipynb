    "A Bayesian Network is a probabilistic graphical model (a type of statistical model) that represents a set of **random variables** and their **conditional dependencies** via a **directed acyclic graph** (DAG). Bayesian networks are often used when we want to represent *causal relationships* between the random variables. They are parameterized by using **Conditional Probability Distributions** (CPD). Each node in the network is parameterized using:\n",

    "## 2. Independencies in Bayesian Networks \n",
    "Independencies implied the by the structure of our bayesian network can be categorized in 2 types:\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "$$X \\perp NonDesc(X)|Pa(X)$$\n",
    "where $NonDesc(X)$ is the set of variables which are not descendents of $X$ and $Pa(X)$ is the set of variables whcih are parents of $X$. \n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/two_nodes.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above two caes it is obvious that change in either node will effect the other. For the first case we can take the example of $difficulty \\rightarrow grade$. If we increase the difficulty of the course the probability of getting a higher grade decreases. For the second case we can take the example of $ SAT \\leftarrow Intel $. Now if we increase the probability of getting a good score in SAT that would imply that the student is intelligent, hence increasing the probability of $ i_1 $. Therefore in both the cases shown above any change in the variables leads to change in the other variable.\n",

    "1. **Causal**: In the general case when we make any changes in the variable $ A $, it will have an effect on variable $ B $ (as we discussed above) and this change in $ B $ will change the values in $ C $. One other possible case can be when $ B $ is observed i.e. we know the value of $ B $. So, in this case any change in $ A $ won't affect $ B $ since we already know the value. And hence there won't be any change in $ C $ as it depends only on $ B $. Mathematically we can say that: \n",

Let's take the example of $ D \\rightarrow G \\leftarrow I $. In this case if we increase the difficulty of the course the probability of getting a higher grade reduces but this has no effect on the intelligence of the student. But when $ B $ is observed let's say that the student got a good grade. Now if we increase the difficulty of the course this will increase the probability of the student to be intelligent since we already know that he got a good grade. Hence in this case \n",

    "## 3. Inference in Bayesian Models\n",
    "Until now we discussed just about representing Bayesian Networks. Now let's see how we can do inference in a Bayesian Model and use it to predict values over new data points for machine learning tasks. In this section we will consider that we already have our model (structure and parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "In inference we try to answer probability queries over the network given some other variables. So, we might want to know the probable grade of an intelligent student in a difficult class given that he scored good in SAT. So for computing these values from a Joint Distribution we will have to reduce over the given variables that is:\n",
    "$$ I = 1, D = 1, S = 1 $$ \n",
    "and then marginalize over the other variables that is \n",
    "$$ L $$ \n",
    "to get \n",
    "$$ P(G | I=1, D=1, S=1) $$\n",
    "But carrying on marginalize and reduce operations on the complete Joint Distribution is computationaly expensive since we need to iterate over the whole table for each operation and the table is exponential in size to the number of variables. But in Graphical Models we exploit the independencies to break these operations in smaller parts making it much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the very basic methods of inference in Graphical Models is **Variable Elimination**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Variable Elimination\n",
    "We know that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(D, I, G, L, S) = P(L|G) * P(S|I) * P(G|D, I) * P(D) * P(I) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say we just want to compute the probability of G. For that we will need to marginalize over all the other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(G) = \\sum_{D, I, L, S} P(D, I, G, L, S) $$ \n",
    "#$$ P(G) = \\sum_{D, I, L, S} P(L|G) * P(S|I) * P(G|D, I) * P(D) * P(I) $$\n",
    "$$ P(G) = \\sum_D \\sum_I \\sum_L \\sum_S P(L|G) * P(S|I) * P(G|D, I) * P(D) * P(I) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now since not all the conditional distributions depend on all the variables we can push the summations inside:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(G) = \\sum_D P(D) \\sum_I P(G|D, I) * P(I) \\sum_S P(S|I) \\sum_L P(L|G) $$\n",
    "\n",
